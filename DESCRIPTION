Title: Wrappers for 'GDAL' Utilities Executables
Version: 1.2.3

Description: R's 'sf' package ships with self-contained 'GDAL'
    executables, including a bare bones interface to several
    'GDAL'-related utility programs collectively known as the 'GDAL
    utilities'. For each of those utilities, this package provides an
    R wrapper whose formal arguments closely mirror those of the
    'GDAL' command line interface. The utilities operate on data
    stored in files and typically write their output to other
    files. Therefore, to process data stored in any of R's more common
    spatial formats (i.e. those supported by the 'sp', 'sf', and
    'raster' packages), first write them to disk, then process them
    with the package's wrapper functions before reading the outputted
    results back into R. GDAL function arguments introduced in GDAL
    version 3.5.2 or earlier are supported.
